# cli
A CLI for vend.io


There are a few branches in this repo. The purpose is to determine which programming language
will help build the CLI prototype without much hassle of re-inventing the wheel.

# Usage

Note: This library is WIP. However, to compile and run:
```bash
./run
# if it doesn't run then set permissions
chmod +x ./run
# then run
./run
```
